## üíª How to Use the Application

Using the prompt generator is simple:

1.  **Serve the files using a local web server.** For security reasons, modern browsers block the functionality of this application if you open the `index.html` file directly from your computer. The easiest way to run a local web server is to use Python. Open your terminal in this directory and run: `python -m http.server`.
2.  **Open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.** This will launch the application.
3.  **Select a Category** from the sidebar on the left.
4.  **Choose a Prompt** from the list that appears.
4.  **Fill in the Form** with your specific information for each placeholder.
5.  **Click "Generate Prompt"** to create the final, customized prompt.
