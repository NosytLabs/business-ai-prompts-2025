```
Provide constructive feedback on a design mockup.

Feedback Context:

Structure the feedback using the "Objective-Subjective-Actionable" framework:
1.  **Objective:** What do you see? (e.g., "The main call-to-action button is orange and located below the hero image.")
2.  **Subjective:** How does it make you feel or react? (e.g., "The button feels a bit lost at the bottom, and the orange color clashes with the blue background.")
3.  **Actionable:** What do you suggest? (e.g., "Could we try moving the button into the hero section and testing a color with more contrast, like white or yellow?")

- **Subjective:** My eye is not immediately drawn to the button; it seems to blend in with the other blue elements. It doesn't feel like the most important thing on the page.
- **Actionable:** Could we test a variation where the button is a contrasting color, like orange or green, to make it stand out more? It might also be worth experimenting with its placement, perhaps centering it below the main headline.
