- Cost reduction
- Quality improvements
- Employee satisfaction

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
- Priority order
- Resource requirements
- Timeline
- Success metrics
```

**Example Output**:
```
**Workflow: New Hire IT Setup**

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- **Process:** Manual process involving 5 separate emails to IT, HR, and Facilities.
- **Bottleneck:** Waiting for manager approval before IT can provision accounts.
- **Performance:** Takes an average of 3 days for a new hire to get full system access.

**OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:**
